BMI CALCULATOR - FLUTTER

I have created a BMI checker which will take input from the user like HEIGHT and WEIGHT and AGE from the user and it will calculate the bmi and print the BMI VALUE as well as it will give you a quick summary about your BMI like:

According to BMI VALUES:
if it ranges from :
--> BMI < 16 : SEVERE THINNESS
--> BMI is in betweeen 16 and 17 : MODERATE THINNESS
--> BMI is in betweeen 17 and 18.5 : MILD THINNESS
--> BMI is in betweeen 18.5 and 125 : NORMAL
--> BMI is in betweeen 25 and 30 : OVERWEIGHT
--> BMI is in betweeen 30 and 35 : OBESE CLASS I 
--> BMI is in betweeen 35 and 40 : OBESE CLASS II
--> BMI > 40 : OBESE CLASS III
     
and i have used "DART" language and implemented it successfully. 
These are outputs of different examples that i have tried our in my bmi checker.
Screenshots with examples with different BMI summary of the patient.
